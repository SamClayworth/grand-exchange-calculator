The Grand Exchange Calculator!

I needed a customized price calculator for a Red Dead Redemption 2 Roleplay Server (yeehaw!), and I knew I could make an Excel Spreadsheet and call it a day. However, where is the fun in that? I wanted to code a price calculator using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript that I could use during my gameplay to make my life easier.

HOW TO USE:

1. Adjust Price category to change each items price.
2. Change Quantity to sell more than one item.
3. See the total summary at the bottom.
